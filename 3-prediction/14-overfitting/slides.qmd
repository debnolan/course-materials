# Concept Questions

## RQ 1

```{r}
countdown::countdown(2, top = 0)
```

:::{.poll}
Which one of these is not an example of overfitting (either in real life or in statistics)?
:::



## Are RSS and R square necessarily related?

```{r}
countdown::countdown(2, top = 0)
```

:::{.poll}
If I decrease the RSS (e.g. by fitting a more accurate model) then the $R^2$ value necessarily has to go up?

```{r}

```

:::{.poll}
Overfit models tend to...

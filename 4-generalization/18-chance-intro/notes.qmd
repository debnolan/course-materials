[I]{.dropcap}n the last set of notes, we revisited the data cycle, and saw that, in order to use the obtained data to answer a question about our
*target population*, we have to make sure that our data is
representative of the population. Most people have  some
understanding of what it means for a sample to be representative. In
the picture below, which sample would you say better represents the
population in the box?

The mechanisms and methods we use for obtaining
data are crucial in determining whether the data will be
useful in answering our question about the target population. They are
the *protocols* for our experimental design, or measurements,
or survey design and sampling. For example, if the data are from a
clinical trial for a new Covid-19 treatment, the design of the trial
will decide who gets the treatment, and who doesn't. Or perhaps we
want to poll voters to see if there is support for decriminalizing
marijuana possession federally (President Biden took a first step
towards this goal by pardoning all Americans  convicted of simple
marijuana possession under federal law). Who is selected for such an 
opinion poll can make a big difference in the estimate of the proportion of voters that support decriminalization of marijuana. You may have observed that some
polling companies are more successful than others in their estimates
and predictions, and consequently they are taken more seriously.
Below is a snapshot of rankings of polling organizations from the well-known
website FiveThirtyEight[^538]. According to the website, the rankings are based on the polling organization's ``historical accuracy and methodology''

[^538]: This website was begun as poll aggregation site, by the statistician Nate Silver.]

In these notes, we are going to describe a mechanism by which we can
obtain representative samples from the target population - or rather,
from our access frame. In practice, it is rare for the access frame
and target population to exactly coincide. We need to design our
data collection methods (our *protocols*) so that our target
population and our access frame overlap as much as we can manage. This
is achieved using chance, or probability, methods.

## Introducing the Box Model

One of the simplest ways of understanding chance is by considering a
*box model*. [^fppbox]. A box model consists of a box with
numbered tickets, and we draw tickets from this box at random [^uar].
To specify a box model, we have to say what tickets go in the box, and
whether they will be drawn *with* or without replacement}. That
is, after drawing a ticket from the box, do we put it back in the box
or not, before we draw another ticket.

![](images/box-1.jpeg){fig-align=center width="400"}

Consider the box above. The chance of drawing a ticket labeled "4" is one
in five, as there are five tickets to choose from and only one is
labeled "4". The chance of drawing a ticket marked "2" is two in five,
since there are two tickets labeled "2" out of the five tickets in
the box.

Let's practice creating boxes to model common scenarios. For each of the cases below, specify:
1. The box and tickets (how many tickets, and what are the values on the tickets)
2. The number of draws
3. Whether we replace tickets between draws
Remember, the tickets in the box have to be *equally likely* to be drawn.

* coin tosses: what box and which tickets would you use to simulate one coin toss?

We could use the box:

You could also use the following box, with the ticket $\fbox{1}$ representing the coin landing heads, and $\fbox{0}$ representing the coin landing tails.

Can you think of advantages of using the second box?

## The `sample()` function in R

## Code along

As you read through these notes, keep RStudio open in another window to code along at the console.
:::

The box model is easily simulated in R, since there is a convenient function to do exactly what we need: draw tickets from a "box" (a vector). We will use the function `sample(x, size = n, replace = FALSE)`, where `x` is the vector you want to sample from, `size` is the number of draws (with the default value being the length of `x`), and you specify with `replace` whether you want to draw the tickets with or without replacement. The default is to draw them without replacement. 

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
box <- c(1, 2, 2, 3, 4)
sample(box,1)
```







We can use this simple box to model many \textit{chance processes}
that we can observe around us, for example:
 - tossing a coin 10 times, and counting the number of heads in these
 10 tosses
 - rolling a pair of dice and adding the spots
 - spinning a roulette wheel 
 - selecting voters for an opinion poll
 - deciding which participants in a clinical trial get the treatment,
 and which don't.

 ### Rolling dice



 

[^fppbox]: The box model was introduced by Freedman, Pisani, and
Purves in their textbook
[*Statistics*](https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393929720)
[^uar]: Drawing a ticket at random means each ticket in
the box is equally likely to be drawn.
